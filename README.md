Credit card fraud detection code and report.

I used python to create the code and then kaggle to find the database (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)!

The dataset was balanced using undersampling technique and both classes are balanced with 7506 transactions for the training stage

The model uses a CNN architecture and gets the results: 0.858 accuracy, 0.96 precision, 0.747 recall, 0.84 f1 score.
